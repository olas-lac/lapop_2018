## LAPOP 2018/19

This repository contains the information necessary for generating the indicators used by the OLAS. The repository contains two scripts and two folders, inputs and outputs.

### Inputs
- exchange_rates_wb.xls - World bank exchange rates for converting monetary indicators
- LAPOP IDB 2018-9 (from merge).Rda - Full LAPOP 2018-19 dataset
- lapop_2018_income_table.csv - Lookup table for income amounts for each value in the LAPOP dataset

### Scripts
This repository contains two scripts, the r script for processing the raw data and generating indicators and the STATA script used to imputate incomes from the 
ranges included in the LAPOP survey.

-olas_lapop_2019.R
-income_generation_2019.do

Users should run the code from olas_lapop_2019.R up to line 100. Then, users should add a folder in their project called 
"stata_income_generation" for houseing the income data generated by the .do file, and then run income_generation_2019.do. 
Once users confirm that the stata_income_generation folder contains a file for each country, users should run lines 101 - 506 of the olas_lapop_2019.R script.

### Outputs

The script outputs the final indicator dataset in a few formats (wide and long). If users are interested in the data without wanting to run the scripts, 
the long version is available in this repository.
